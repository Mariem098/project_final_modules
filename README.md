The second functions returns the index of the nth occurrence of a substring within a string and in case there are less than n occurrences of the substring it return -1.
The third function takes two given strings (a,b) and the first one has at most one asterix character , it checks if the the asterix in string (a) can be replaced with a sequence (maybe even empty) then will it matches string (b), if yes return true otherwise return false.
